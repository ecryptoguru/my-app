Prompt 1: Project Setup
Objective: Establish the foundational structure of the Next.js 15 project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Lucide icons for a modern development environment.

What Needs to Be Done:
Initialize Next.js 15 with TypeScript:
Use the command to create a new project with TypeScript and App Router: npx create-next-app@latest --typescript
Verify the project structure includes tsconfig.json and appropriate directories (app, components, etc.).
Install and Configure Tailwind CSS:
Install dependencies: npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer.
Initialize Tailwind: npx tailwindcss init -p.
Update tailwind.config.js to include content paths (e.g., './app/**/*.{ts,tsx}', './components/**/*.{ts,tsx}').
Add Tailwind directives to app/globals.css: @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;.
Install UI Libraries:
Install Shadcn UI: npx shadcn-ui@latest init
Add components as needed: npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
Install Lucide icons: npm install lucide-react.
Verify installations by importing a sample component and icon in a test file.
Create a Sample Page:
Modify app/page.tsx to include a Shadcn UI button with a Lucide icon (e.g., a "Play" icon).
Example code:

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { Play } from "lucide-react";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <Button>
        <Play className="mr-2" /> Start
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}
Run the app (npm run dev) and confirm the button displays correctly.

Prompt 2: File Upload Component
Objective: Build a reusable component to upload and parse PDF, XLS, and DOCX files, storing them in Supabase Storage and passing parsed data to parent components.

What Needs to Be Done:
Component Structure:
Create components/FileUpload.tsx with a drag-and-drop area or file input using <input type="file">.
Use TypeScript to define props: onFileProcessed: (data: any, fileUrl: string) => void.
Install Parsing Libraries:
Install dependencies: npm install pdfjs-dist xlsx mammoth.
Import libraries: pdfjs-dist for PDFs, xlsx (SheetJS) for XLS, mammoth for DOCX.
File Upload to Supabase Storage:
Initialize Supabase client with credentials from environment variables.
Upload file: Use supabase.storage.from('uploads').upload(file.name, file) and retrieve the public URL.
File Parsing:
PDF: Use pdfjs.getDocument(file).promise to extract text.
XLS: Use XLSX.read(await file.arrayBuffer(), { type: 'array' }) to parse into JSON.
DOCX: Use mammoth.extractRawText({ arrayBuffer: await file.arrayBuffer() }) to get text.
Handle errors (e.g., invalid file format) with try-catch blocks.
Callback and UI:
Pass parsed data and file URL to the parent via onFileProcessed.
Add loading states and error messages using Shadcn UI components (e.g., spinner, alert).

Prompt 3: Authentication
Objective: Secure the application with user authentication using Next.js Auth (AuthJS), supporting email/password and Google OAuth.

What Needs to Be Done:
Install AuthJS:
Run npm install @auth/core @auth/nextjs
Configure Auth:
Create app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts:
example code:

import NextAuth from "next-auth";
import GoogleProvider from "@auth/core/providers/google";
import CredentialsProvider from "@auth/core/providers/credentials";
import { authConfig } from "@/auth.config";

const handler = NextAuth({
  ...authConfig,
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET,
    }),
    CredentialsProvider({
      name: "Credentials",
      credentials: { email: {}, password: {} },
      async authorize(credentials) {
        // Add logic to verify email/password (e.g., check against Supabase).
        return { id: "1", name: "User", email: credentials.email };
      },
    }),
  ],
});

export { handler as GET, handler as POST };

Create auth.config.ts in the root directory with default session options and callbacks.
Add environment variables in .env.local: GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, AUTH_SECRET.
Integrate with UI:
Use useSession from next-auth/react to check authentication status.
Add sign-in/out buttons to the dashboard.
Security Recommendations:
Encrypt sensitive data in Supabase using row-level security.
Use HTTPS in production and secure cookies with secure: true.

Prompt 4: DeepSeek API Integration
Objective: Enable AI-powered features by integrating DeepSeek APIs with reusable code for API calls.

What Needs to Be Done:
Setup API Client:
Create lib/deepseek.ts with a function to handle API requests.
Use fetch with API key from .env.local (e.g., DEEPSEEK_API_KEY).
Sample Request:
Example for time series forecasting:

async function callDeepSeek(endpoint: string, data: any) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.deepseek.com/${endpoint}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${process.env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(data),
  });
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error("API request failed");
  return response.json();
}
Error Handling and Rate Limits:
Add retries for failed requests (e.g., 429 status).
Log errors and return user-friendly messages.
Reusability:
Make the function generic for different endpoints (e.g., clustering, optimization).

Prompt 5: Dashboard Layout
Objective: Create a user-friendly dashboard with a collapsible sidebar for navigation.

Use Tailwind CSS for a grid or flex layout.
Sidebar Navigation:
Add links: "Demand Forecasting", "Inventory Management", "Pricing Strategies", "Customer Segmentation", "Supplier Performance", "Business Reporting", "Settings".
Use Lucide icons (e.g., BarChart, Package) with Shadcn UI buttons.
Collapsible Sidebar:
Add a toggle button (e.g., Menu icon) to collapse/expand on mobile.
Use Tailwind's responsive classes (e.g., md:flex hidden).
Styling:
Apply a clean, professional theme (e.g., gray sidebar, white content area).
Implement as a React Server Component for better performance.

Prompt 6: Database and Storage Setup
Objective: Configure Supabase for data storage and file uploads.

What Needs to Be Done:
Install Supabase Client:
Run npm install @supabase/supabase-js.
Setup Supabase:
Create lib/supabase.ts:
example code:

import { createClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js";

export const supabase = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
Add .env.local variables: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY.
CRUD Operations:
Example: Insert into users table:

await supabase.from("users").insert({ id: "1", name: "Test User" });
File Storage:
Upload: supabase.storage.from('uploads').upload('file.pdf', file).
Get URL: supabase.storage.from('uploads').getPublicUrl('file.pdf').

Prompt 7: Feature Page Template
Objective: Build a reusable template for feature pages with consistent structure.

Input Section:
Include <FileUpload /> or a form with TypeScript-typed inputs.
Data Mapping:
Use a table or dropdowns to map fields (e.g., "Column A" to "Sales").
Processing:
Call DeepSeek API with placeholder endpoint and data.
Visualization:
Use Chart.js or a table with placeholder data.
Storage:
Save to Supabase with a generic table structure.
